     <h4 style="font-family:calibri;">Nuclear propulsion, a process using nuclear reactions to produce thrust, could well be used more often in the future for deep space exploration. This article explores the fundamentals, benefits and drawbacks of nuclear propulsion compared with the widely used technique of chemical propulsion and investigates whether nuclear propulsion systems should be integrated into more space missions. Overall, whilst nuclear propulsion methods produce less thrust than chemical engines, they can run for long periods of time benefiting longer trips and are therefore a viable option for deep space exploration. </h4>

    <h3 id="Introduction"><b>Introduction</b></h3>
  </P>
  <p class="ex1">
    
      <h4 style="font-family:calibri;">As space agencies grow a bigger interest in exploring deeper into space, they must also develop their technology to do so. 
      With travel distances expanding, nuclear propulsion may be the solution engineers have been looking for since they are twice as efficient as chemical rockets meaning they could lower travel times by half (Kotlyar, 2024). 
      Nuclear propulsion simply works by many nuclear reactions generating thrust opposed to chemical rockets where liquid propellants are combusted. 
      This technique can provide high thrust whilst using propellant more efficiently than usual chemical rockets decreasing travel times and increasing payload mass (NASA, 2024). 
      Firstly, an understanding of  how each type of nuclear propulsion system works is discussed followed by a comparison with conventional chemical engines using statistics to outline the benefits of each system.</h4>

    <h3 id="How do different types of propulsion work?"><b>How do different types of propulsion work?</b></h3>
  </p>
  <p class="ex1">

    <h4 style="font-family:calibri;">The first type of propulsion is nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP). NTP works by running liquid hydrogen through the core of a nuclear reactor which in turn splits uranium atoms which releases heat in the form of fission. The liquid propellant is converted into a hot gas which rapidly expands and leaves the nozzle at a high velocity producing thrust (Office of Nuclear Energy, 2021) as shown in figure 1.</h4>
    <img scr="NTPimage.png" alt="NTPimage" width="1400" height="900">
    <h4 style="font-family:calibri;">The second type is nuclear electric propulsion (NEP). Much like NTP, NEP uses a reactor to provide heat from fission but this thermal energy is converted into electric power where it is then used to ionize a propellant which accelerates out the nozzle producing thrust. These are call ion thrusters or Hall thrusters (Osenar, 2004).</h4>
    <img scr="NEPimage.png" alt="NEPimage" width="1400" height="900">
    <h4 style="font-family:calibri;">Liquid propulsion is the most common type of chemical propulsion. Liquid propulsion systems can either be monopropellant (a single propellant fluid) or bi-propellant ( two fluids, a fuel and an oxidizer) ( Glenn Research Centre, 2023). These propellants are stored in tanks and flow towards the engine either by pressure (pressure-fed) or by turbopumps  (pump-fed). This fuel is then ignited in two ways; by the two fuels coming in contact with each other (hypergolic propellants) or by an ignition system (Glenn Research Centre, 2023). Both of these techniques will cause a large amount of thrust to be produced. Figure 3 shows a diagram visualizing a pressure-fed engine.</h4>

  <h3 id="Analysis_of_propulsion_systems"><b>Analysis of propulsion systems</b></h3>
</p>
<p class="ex1">
    <h4 style="font-family:calibri;">There are many advantages of nuclear propulsion to chemical propulsion however it comes with its own disadvantages. Efficiency is always an important factor when dealing with any sort of system. In rocketry efficiency is also referred to as specific impulse, which is the amount of thrust produced by a certain amount of propellant (Office of Nuclear Energy, 2021). Nuclear thermal propulsion has a specific impulse of 900 seconds whereas chemical rockets produce a specific impulse of 450 seconds resulting in chemical rockets being half as efficient (Office of Nuclear Energy, 2021). This is due to the propellants being used by each engine. NTP uses hydrogen as its propellant whilst chemical rockets produce a byproduct of water vapor which is much heavier than hydrogen allowing nuclear engines to travel greater distances using less fuel (Office of Nuclear Energy, 2021). 
    </h4>
    <h4 style="font-family: calibri;">Although nuclear propulsion has a higher specific impulse, they do not provide enough thrust to take off from Earth like chemical rockets. This is why they would primarily be used on second stages for travelling to other planets once out of our gravitational field where there is no large external force acting against the system. For example SpaceXâ€™s Raptor 2 engine can produce 250 tons of thrust (Sesnic, 2022) whereas an NTP engine will on average produce 11 tons (Kelvey, 2023), roughly 23 times less thrust therefore lowering the possible payload capacity.
    </h4>
      <h4 style="font-family:calibri;">The reactor within the engine has safety features like shielding to reduce the amount of radiation the crew on board is exposed to, they will still be exposed to small amounts released from the engine. However in the overall outcome of a mission to Mars using NTP would reduce the travel time by 3 to 4 months (Kim, 2015) lowering the crews exposer to solar and cosmic radiation. The level of radiation that astronauts could be exposed to if chemical rockets are used is dangerously high and exceeds the exposer limit proving that NTP will benefit the safety of the crew onboard (Kim, 2015).</h4>
    
</p>
<p>  
  <h3 id="Conclusion"><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
</p>
<p class="ex1">
    <h4 style="font-family:calibri;">This paper has assessed the overall effectiveness of nuclear propulsion and whether it should be used as an alternative to chemical rockets. From analysing some of the most important factors when it comes to engineering a rocket engine both nuclear and chemical provide their own benefits like the efficiency of a nuclear engine having a specific impulse double that of chemical engines allowing shorter travel times resultantly saving resources and benefitting the crews health and safety. On the other hand, chemical engines provide a much larger amount of thrust meaning larger payloads, saving resources. The development of nuclear propulsion is still quite a new concept and has only been developed in the past hundred years so there is still more data to be collected to properly understand if it is beneficial to integrate these systems on most rockets for future missions to Mars.</h4>
